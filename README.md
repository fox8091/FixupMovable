# FixupMovable
Fixes up a movable.sed from another console to allow booting without CFW. This is primarily useful for [Manual Movable Moveover](https://wiki.hacks.guide/wiki/3DS:Manual_Movable_Moveover).

## How it works
This works by marking the file as not having an AES-MAC, using [3dbrew](https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/Nand/private/movable.sed) as documentation
